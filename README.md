# 32-bit-processor

## Introduction
This 32-bit processor was written in Verilog for a Advanced Digital Logic Design class in my final year of electrical engineering.

The project required us to create a 32-bit processor and write the logic for the opcodes from scratch. I worked primarily on the ram, multiplexers, 32-bit parsing, program counter, parts of the arithmetic logic unit and wiring, and various tests.

The processor includes:
- ram
- multiplexers
- arithmetic logic unit
- program counter
- register bank
